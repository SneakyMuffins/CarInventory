# car-inventory
Car inventory sorting (SS and CS) with a repository pattern

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. PHP: Make sure you have PHP installed on your system. You can check if PHP is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

If PHP is not installed, you can download and install it from the official PHP website.

2. Composer: Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. If you don't have Composer installed, you can download and install it by following the instructions on the Composer website.

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the PHP application:

1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory and run composer install
3. Run the PHP Server: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the PHP development server by running the following command:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

This command will start a development server that listens on localhost at port 8000. You can access your PHP application in a web browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000.

#Public URLS
In this instance, you need to access the following URL: *http://localhost:8000/public/cartable/index.html*
